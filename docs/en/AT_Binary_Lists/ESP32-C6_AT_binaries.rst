Released Firmware
=================

:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

It is recommended to use the lastest version of firmware. Currently, Espressif only releases AT firmware for the following {IDF_TARGET_NAME} series of modules. 

.. note::
  If there is no released firmware for your module, you can either use the firmware for the module that has the same hardware configuration as yours (see :doc:`../Compile_and_Develop/esp-at_firmware_differences` for which module has the same configuration), or if you need to modify the following configurations, you can generate a new firmware for your module by modifying the released firmware using the :doc:`../Compile_and_Develop/tools_at_py`.

  * :ref:`at-py-modify-uart`
  * :ref:`at-py-modify-wifi`
  * :ref:`at-py-modify-pki`
